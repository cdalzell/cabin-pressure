# "Cabin Pressure"

Once upon a time, I decided I needed to add yet another project to my backlog.

Fortunately for me, this was when my wife & I were driving 10 hours (both ways) to visit her family over the holidays. She introduced me to the BBC radio program "Cabin Pressure" and it gave me some ideas..

* I spend 95% of my dev time data munging, "doing a DATA SCIENCE", and API/DB architecture.
* When it comes to the front end/UI layer, I'm usually at a loss. I can follow the plot and make small changes but if you want anything serious accomplished you're SOL
* I've been thinking about getting back in to flight simming and pushing G-ERTI around sounds BRILLIANT! Also I've always had a soft spot in my heart (head?) for CRJs :)

Therefore, in true personal fashion I came up with the most wildly overly optimistic and overly complicated idea I was capable of at the moment:

* Create a site that provides random destination ideas for charter flights
* Allow for search parameters such as:
    - Origination ICAO
    - Great Circle range between airfields
    - Runway length
* Use all the latest UI tech that all my favorite cool kids are using in **production environments**. Webpack, React, Node, etc..
* Back end? Where we're going we don't need non-UI layers.. If you can't publish to the gh-pages branch GTFO.
